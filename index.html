                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Zachary Kaufman. I'm an Accelerated Masters student studying Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. 
                        I have been working as a Research Assistant since September of 2020 in the R-House Human-Robot Interaction lab. 
                        My research has primarily focused on robot perception (using methods in computer vision and wearable sensors) for assistive robots being used 
                        with elderly adults, children, and in healthcare.

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>My research primarily focuses in robot perception (using computer vision and wearable sensors) and cognitive science for applications within
                        Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Currently I am working on a perception project for Honda Research Institute's robot prototype Haru in which we
                        are creating a computer vision algorithm to pair with non-invasive physiological sensors (such as a thermal camera) to detect engagement in
                        children interacting with the robot. Another project I am involved in is alongside IU's Computer Vision lab and Toyota Research Institute. We are using 
                        LuxAI's QT robot to create interactions with elderly adults to help them find their "ikigai", a Japanese concept that roughly translates to "purpose 
                        for being." The final project I am involved in is in collaboration with Mississippi State University on their Therabot robot for Major Depressive
                        Disorder patients. 
                    </p>
                    <!--<h2>Projects</h2>
                    <p>Most of the projects I post <a href="/projects">here</a> or on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaufdroptech/">Instagram</a>
                    are more creative than functional. Through studying engineering I often get to makes things that actually function, like robots, games, or
                    machine learning applications. Through studying digital art, however, I get to be more impractical. I can use CAD and creative coding to explore imagination and just
                    try things that may oy may not ever work. Primarily those are the types of projects you'll see here or on my social media page.<br><br>

                    Most of the CAD work I do is in Blender, however, I have also worked in Maya, and Rhino.
                    I like to focus on Sci-Fi or Fantasy scenarios in my 3D design work, but I also enjoy abstract animation. I often 3D print my designs because I find
                    fabrication to be a natural and exciting next step to digital design.</p> -->
